# CS178_Retro_Project

Retro Gaming Hardware

Advisor: Prof. Allan Knight
Description: Using FPGAs and a hardware definition language such as Verilog, it is possible to bring vintage arcade games back to life. This project would involve coding a processor such as the Intel 8088 and then running images such as PacMan on the FPGA to bring back the original game play.
Learning outcomes: Verilog programming and hardware emulation as well as basic software systems
Are multiple teams accepted? Yes
Tools: FPGA boards such as Digilent Zybo Z7, Xilinx Vivado
