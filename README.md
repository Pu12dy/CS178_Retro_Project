# CS178_Retro_Project

### Team:
Jeff Purdy, Hani Cierlak, Raymond Yuan, and Daisy Cheng

## Overview of our Project: 
We created a side-scrolling space-themed NES shooter game in the style of classic games such as Gradius and Macross. Our game, Destination Unknown, features 4 distinct levels with unique encounters and visuals. The game can be loaded onto any MOS Technology 6502 8-bit processor(NES).

## Features:
* Player movement, shooting, animations
* Enemy movement and shooting AI with animations
* Environment obstacles that damage, heal or warp you to other levels and locations
* Boss fights
* A seamless playthrough from start screen to each level to the end screens

## Project Milestones:
* Getting an image to display on-screen that moves to input
* Learning assembly and scripting initial behaviors
* Response to user input such as moving,and Object collision
* Shooting, side-scrolling, and enemy behaviors
* Interactions between different objects such as damage and healing
* A cohesive game experience with title screens, level transitions,  boss fights, and more!
